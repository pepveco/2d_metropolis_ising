# 2D Ising Model – Monte Carlo Simulation (Metropolis Algorithm)

This repository contains MATLAB codes and materials related to the study of the **2D Ising model** using the **Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm**.

## What is a Sweep?

In Monte Carlo simulations of spin systems, a **sweep** (also called a Monte Carlo step) means that, on average, **each spin in the lattice has been selected once for an update attempt**.  
For a lattice of size \( N \times N \), one sweep corresponds to \( N^2 \) single-spin flip attempts.

## What is the Simulation?

A **Monte Carlo simulation** in this context is a numerical experiment where the spin system evolves according to the **Metropolis algorithm**.  
At each step, a spin is randomly chosen and a flip is proposed. The flip is accepted or rejected based on the change in energy and the system temperature, ensuring that the dynamics converge toward the statistical equilibrium distribution.  
By repeating this process over many sweeps, one can study physical quantities such as the **magnetization** and compare them with theoretical predictions.

## Contents

- **`magnetization_T_fixed.m`**  
  Simulation of the 2D Ising model at a **fixed temperature**.  
  The code shows the **time evolution of magnetization** as a function of the number of sweeps.  
  Intermediate **snapshots of the spin configuration** are displayed during the dynamics.

- **`m_scan_multiple_temp.m`**  
  Simulation of the 2D Ising model across a **range of temperatures**.  
  The code computes the **equilibrium average magnetization** after thermalization and compares the results with **Onsager’s exact theoretical solution**.  
  Output: plot of simulated vs. theoretical magnetization.

- **`presentation_exam.pdf`**  
  A presentation (in Italian) prepared for the exam.  
  It contains **plots generated by the simulations**, with additional **comments and explanations**.

## Key Features

- Implementation of the **Metropolis algorithm** with periodic boundary conditions.  
- Two complementary approaches:
  - **Fixed T, magnetization vs sweeps**  
  - **Variable T, magnetization vs temperature**  
- Comparison with the **analytical critical temperature**  
  \[
  T_c = \frac{2}{\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}
  \]

## Theoretical Background

The theoretical framework and reference material for these simulations are detailed in  
**“Monte Carlo Statistical Physics” by Newman and Barkema**,  
which provides a comprehensive introduction to the Ising model and Monte Carlo methods in statistical physics.
